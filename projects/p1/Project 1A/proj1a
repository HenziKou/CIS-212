Hello, my name is Henzi Kou. I am a senior enrolled as a Mathematics and Computer Science major,
along with a Multimedia minor. I have no prior experience with the C language. The languages I know
are Python, JavaScript, and Java. With this class I am hoping to add C into my repertoire of
computer languages. My goal is to learn as much as I can possibly learn and have a deeper 
understanding of the fundamental computer language that is the predecessor of the more modern
languages such as Python.

Learning the basics of the Unix system also allows for a greater understanding of how the computer
works beyond the screens, keyboards and mouses. It is also one of the most widely reaching
operating systems that is still essential to the programming world today. With the additional
lesson of data structures, this will help me understand how the computer organizes internal data
and files. By understanding how this organizational structure works hopefully I can learn how to
optimize the speed of programs and the computer.
